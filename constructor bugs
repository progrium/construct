Suggestions:

* Prevent draggable blocks from moving outside the screen/onto the sidebar
* Screen resize feature (or maybe object resize)?
* Custom blocks (which can be created via the grid's right click menu)
* Right-click feature menu for the sidebar (delete, collapse, etc.)?
* Batch-select blocks to move/delete?

Grid bugs:

* can select all text (in blocks) by double-clicking it, right clicking, double-clicking it again (firefox)
    - "document.execCommand" doesn't work (line 337)
* can select text in the block's empty node (the one without a circle or an arrow on its right)
* right clicking on element titles freezes text selection (chrome/webkit)
* text in nodes can overlap the textbox if the block's inital body is small enough
* pressing spacebar in block's title makes the block's body a lot bigger than typing regular characters
* summoning any node besides "expression" breaks the right-click menu

Sidebar bugs:

* Dragging breaks after hotweb reloads the file
* Big declaration blocks sometimes don't swap places properly

Go bugs:
* Server port is still in use after suspending the application (ctrl+z)
